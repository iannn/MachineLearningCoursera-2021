# MachineLearningCoursera-2021
My solutions to Coursera's Machine Learning class (2021)

Completed using Octave 6.1.0

I don't have the original starter files anymore and the course has been updated as of January 10, 2022 so only my solutions are being uploaded. I don't think I did any of the bonus problems either.

It is important to note that additional resources for the assignments found under the "Resources" and "Discussion Forums" section of the class has a lot of extra information about running Octave/Matlab code, what these programming assignments were actually asking for, and corrections to the lectures. Some Octave code needed in assignments came directly from these resources and could be copied almost verbatim for it to work as intended.

Because I didn't read these additional resources initially, I sat down and figured out the matrix algebra and Octave code myself for the early exercises when the course actually expected submissions with for loops. I did this because the whole point of doing this course was to help review linear algebra and statistics with some practical programming examples.
