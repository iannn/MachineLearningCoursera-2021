function centroids = kMeansInitCentroids(X, K)
%KMEANSINITCENTROIDS This function initializes K centroids that are to be 
%used in K-Means on the dataset X
%   centroids = KMEANSINITCENTROIDS(X, K) returns K initial centroids to be
%   used with the K-Means on the dataset X
%

% You should return this values correctly
centroids = zeros(K, size(X, 2));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: You should set centroids to randomly chosen examples from
%               the dataset X
%

#Didn't read instructions properly and they actually wanted to use this code
% Randomly reorder the indices of examples
randidx = randperm(size(X, 1));
% Take the first K examples as centroids
centroids = X(randidx(1:K), :);

#This was what I did but it allows for duplicate centroids so theirs is better
#centroids = X(randi(size(X,1),K),:);
